# compatible_shortcuts
This project aims at setting compatible keyboard shortcuts to help
people who are switching Linux/Windows environment often to be able
to get expectable results for the keyboard shorcuts pressed.

Basic Idea:
- keep Gnome defaults where possible
- add the windows shortcuts
- add keypad mapping to media keys with <Control><Alt>KP_*
- add terminal launcher to <Control><Alt>t <Super>t
